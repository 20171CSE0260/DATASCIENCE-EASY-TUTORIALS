The SQL language is widely used today across web frameworks and database applications.
Knowing SQL gives you the freedom to explore your data, 
and the power to make better decisions. By learning SQL, you will also learn concepts that apply to nearly every data storage system.
execute this commands
<!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________!>
1) SELECT * FROM tablename;
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
eg:SELECT name FROM celebs; 

Question:what order are rows selected from a table?

Answer:In most SQL databases, by default, the rows will be selected in the order that they appear in the table, 
from top to bottom. For instance, if you have a statement like SELECT * FROM table this will select all rows 
from the table from the first row that appears down to the bottom row.
Later on in the other SQL lessons, you will also learn about clauses such as ORDER BY, 
which allow you to set a certain order for how the rows will be returned in the result set.

2)A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns. Tables are sometimes referred to as relations. 
    All data stored in a relational database is of a certain data type. Some of the most common data types are:

INTEGER, a positive or negative whole number
TEXT, a text string
DATE, the date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
REAL, a decimal value


syntax:
CREATE TABLE table_name (
   column_1 data_type, 
   column_2 data_type, 
   column_3 data_type
);

eg:CREATE statements allow us to create a new table in the database. 
You can use the CREATE statement anytime you want to create a new table from scratch.
The statement below creates a new table named celebs
CREATE TABLE celebs (
   id INTEGER, 
   name TEXT, 
   age INTEGER
);
<!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________!>

Insert
The INSERT statement inserts a new row into a table. You can use the INSERT statement when you want to add new records. 
eg:INSERT INTO celebs (id, name, age) 
VALUES (1, 'Justin Bieber', 22);



syntax:INSERT INTO table (col1, col2, col3)
VALUES
(row1_val1, row1_val2, row1_val3),
(row2_val1, row2_val2, row2_val3),
(row3_val1, row3_val2, row3_val3);

eg:insert into celebs(id,name,age)
values(1,'Justin Bieber',22);
insert into celebs(id,name,age) values
(2,'Beyonce Knowles',33),
(3, 'Jeremy Lin', 26),
(4, 'Taylor Swift', 26);
select * from celebs;

Alter
The ALTER TABLE statement adds a new column to a table. You can use this command when you want to add columns to a table.
eg:ALTER TABLE celebs 
ADD COLUMN columnname;

question: can we add a column at a specific position to a table?

Answer:
No, unfortunately, you cannot specify what position to add a column to a table.

By default, a new column will always be added at the end of the table. 
For most intents and purposes, this should not affect much, since you can always select the columns in any order, 
for instance, like
SELECT col3, col1, col2
If column order is very important, then an alternative is to create a new table and 
add the columns in the specific order they should appear.

Update
The UPDATE statement edits a row in a table. You can use the UPDATE statement when you want to change existing records.
eg:UPDATE tablename 
SET colunmnbame = 'value' 
WHERE condition;

question: how is ALTER different from UPDATE?

Answer
Although similar in the sense that both statements will modify a table, these statements are quite different.

The ALTER statement is used to modify columns. With ALTER, you can add columns, remove them, or even modify them.

The UPDATE statement is used to modify rows. However, UPDATE can only update a row, and cannot remove or add rows.







<!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________!>
Delete
The DELETE FROM statement deletes one or more rows from a table. You can use the statement when you want to delete existing records.
eg:DELETE FROM tablename 
WHERE condition;


question:what if we only want to delete a specific number of rows?

Answer
To delete only a specific number of rows, you can utilize the LIMIT statement.
The value provided for LIMIT will be how many rows to affect.

For example, this statement will only delete the first 5 rows that match the condition,

DELETE FROM table
WHERE condition
LIMIT 5;

<!__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________!>
Delete
Constraints
Constraints that add information about how a column can be used are invoked after specifying the data type for a column.
They can be used to tell the database to reject inserted data that does not adhere to a certain restriction.
1. PRIMARY KEY columns can be used to uniquely identify the row. 
Attempts to insert a row with an identical value to a row already in the table will result in a constraint violation which will not allow you to insert the new row.

2. UNIQUE columns have a different value for every row. 
This is similar to PRIMARY KEY except a table can have many different UNIQUE columns.

3. NOT NULL columns must have a value.
Attempts to insert a row without a value for a NOT NULL column will result in a constraint violation and the new row will not be inserted.

4. DEFAULT columns take an additional argument that will be the assumed value for an inserted row if the new row does not specify a value for that column.

a brief in 30seconds:
SQL is a programming language designed to manipulate and manage data stored in relational databases.

A relational database is a database that organizes information into one or more tables.
A table is a collection of data organized into rows and columns.
A statement is a string of characters that the database recognizes as a valid command.

CREATE TABLE creates a new table.
INSERT INTO adds a new row to a table.
SELECT queries data from a table.
ALTER TABLE changes an existing table.
UPDATE edits a row in a table.
DELETE FROM deletes rows from a table.
Constraints add information about how a column can be used
